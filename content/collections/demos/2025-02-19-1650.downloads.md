        text: 'Most doctors recommend getting vaccinations against tetanus and hepatitis A. Also consider a rabies shot â€“ dogs, cats and monkeys can all carry the viral disease. Malaria is present along the borders with Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Malaysia. If you visit these regions, you can use anti-malarial prophylaxis such as atovaquone/proguanil or doxycycline (or do your best not to get bitten by a mosquito). '

The southeast coast and the Gulf of Thailand get soaked slightly later, from October to December. If you do visit at this time, you'll definitely want to pack some kind of wet weather gear."
